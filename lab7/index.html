                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab is to work with functions and experiment with user input to then transfer this input to the js file in Visual Studio Code.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>A problem we experienced was getting our Javascript to show up properly on our webpages. It took a long time to debug some of the problems that where in out code. Another problem we experienced was figuring out how to add in some of the extra features that we were interested in incorporating. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>At the end we were able to complete the Lab and fix all the issues that arose. I would like to fiddle more with the javascript and css to make my webpage more customized in the future. </p>
